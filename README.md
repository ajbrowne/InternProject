Intern Project
==============

1. Clone the project.

2. Install Mongo (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

3. run command : mongo localhost:27017/Specials vehicles.js from the home directory of the project to populate your database
    NOTE: 'mongo' in the above command is the path to your mongo client. If you have that path set as an enviroment variable you can just run mongo. If you don't have that set you need to use the full path to the mongo client instead of just mongo. (i.e. /Users/maharb/Documents/mongodb/mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.6.1/bin/mongo localhost:27017/Specials vehicles.js)
